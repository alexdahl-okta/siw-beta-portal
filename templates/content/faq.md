2. Are there specific use cases I am expected to test and give feedback to the product team?

    We have outlined some core scenarios we expect you to test and share feedback with the product team. We strongly encourage you to play around with the product as much as possible. The goal of this Beta program is to ensure that we build the right products to help address your accessibility needs. Your feedback will help shape our roadmap and deliver a truly differentiated solution that meets our customer needs.

  

3. How much time do I have to test and give feedback?
    The Beta program will run until Oct 31, 2022. As a Beta participant, you have until then to test through all the scenarios and share feedback.

  

4. Who should I contact if I have more questions or need assistance during the Beta?
    
    Each Beta customer will be assigned a specific point of contact to who you can reach out for any questions. Additionally, you will be provided access to a Slack channel to post your questions at any time and get responses from Okta experts.

5. I have a feature request, improvement suggestion, or found a bug while testing. How should I let you know?
    
    Please contact your Beta point of contact to communicate any improvements or suggestions. Alternatively, you can log in and fill out this form to submit any feature requests or suggestions for improvement.

  

6. Where can I find more information on the planned improvements/roadmap for your offering?

    Please tune in to the Okta quarterly roadmap updates. Future roadmap updates will have detailed explanations on the planned roadmap for Okta Sign-In Widget. You can also reach out to your CSM/Account Executive to schedule an EBC to get an update from Okta’s product team on the roadmap.

  

7. What should I do once I have completed testing all the use cases needed for the Beta?

    At the end of every week, you will get a survey from Okta’s User Research team to help us understand how satisfied you are with the overall beta program and what we can do to improve your experience. Additionally, once you have completed testing all the use cases, the User Research team will conduct an exit interview to get detailed feedback on areas of improvement for the Okta Sign-In Widget product and how we can improve your experience for future Beta programs at Okta.

  

8. When will I be able to use this Okta’s Sign-In Widget in my production environment?
    
    Okta’s Sign-In Widget product is scheduled to move to “LImited Early Access” availability by February of 2023. At that time, you will be able to use all of the latest capabilities available with Okta’s Sign-In Widget in your production environment. As always with any product roadmap, timelines are tentative and subject to change.

    Note: Timelines for “Limited Early Access” only apply to customers based in the United States. For all other customers, please see future product roadmap updates or reach out to your CSM to get the latest timelines.
